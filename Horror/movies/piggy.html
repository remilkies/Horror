6/10
What would you do if you were bullied? If your bullies kept constantly harassing you? Would you have the confidence to stand up to them? Would you get revenge? This movie really poses you with the moral dilemma of wether or not a bully deserves a taste of their own medicine; and how much medicine is too much.
