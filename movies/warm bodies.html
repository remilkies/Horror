it felt like watching daphne and fred's origin story. Fred is the zombie and together they protect each other ad solve mysteries. I guarantee you will be asking yourself "there's no way this is real" every 5 minutes. Then again, I 'm high right now, all i can really say for sure is that it's the stupidest movie to watch high lol. Think of this is disney channel's first ever low-budget attempt at a real horror movieHorror, romance, comedy
this is probably one of the worst horror movies, and just movie I've seen in general, i have eve watched. But it's bad in a "the bojack horseman show" kinda way, so i thought maybe i'd like it better high; and i was right, this movie is stupid funny.
